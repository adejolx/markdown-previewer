# Markdown Previewer

Libraries:

- MarkedJS
- HighlightJS
- React-Typescript

Note:

You'll notice that this lacks proper focus management. In an effort to resolve the conflicts between focus shifting between interactive elements on the page and tab spacing when editing markdown, press `shift + tab` for tab-spacing in markdown or `tab` to shift focus to the next interactive element

It's a WIP, the next things I want to do are to

1.  improve on focus management
2.  improve on typography and colors
